# Pitch 

• Game idea: A car racing game

• Characters’ actions and goals: Is for the player (they play a car) to win all 3 levels of the game against other cars.

• Game Win/Lose conditions/ Progression of levels: You start with a car. In level 1, you can easily win against the opponent 
	and your speed increases. The next level is harder, you have to win against a faster car. You can go back to level 1 and increase 
	your exp to increase the speed of your car to win level 2. Then level 3 car is really fast so you have to redo previous levels 
	to increase exp and when you get enough, increase speed, then win level 3.

• Sources of inspiration: friends game + cars movie

   - Not interested in violent games (e.g. shooting games, games including 
   	graphic pictures of blood, etc.
